# CornucopiaHTTP – Just HTTP Requests

🐚 The "horn of plenty" – a symbol of abundance.

## Why?

Syntax matters. With the introduction of `async`/`await` in Swift 5.5, we can finally abstract
the nitty details of asynchronous HTTP networking behind a friendly syntax.

## Integration

It's an SPM-compatible package.

## Usage

TBD
