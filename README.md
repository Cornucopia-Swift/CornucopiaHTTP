# CornucopiaHTTP – Just HTTP Requests

🐚 The "horn of plenty" – a symbol of abundance.

## Why?

Syntax matters. With the introduction of `async`/`await` in Swift 5.5, we can finally abstract
the nitty details of asynchronous HTTP networking behind a friendly syntax.

## Platforms

Everything Apple. The Linux-support is waiting for https://github.com/apple/swift-corelibs-foundation/issues/3205 to be fixed.

## Integration

It's an SPM-compatible package.

## Usage

TBD. For now, please take a look at the tests.

## Contribution

This library is licensed under the terms of the MIT. Contributions are always welcome. Stay safe and sound!
